**Seamlessly integrate Taiponrock devices and services with Node-RED for powerful automation.**

</div>

## 📖 Overview

`node-red-contrib-taiponrock` provides a custom Node-RED node designed to simplify interaction with Taiponrock systems. This contribution allows Node-RED users to easily connect their flows to Taiponrock devices or services, enabling robust automation, data collection, and control functionalities directly within the familiar visual programming environment.

Whether you're building IoT solutions, industrial automation, or integrating various smart devices, this node acts as a bridge, abstracting the complexities of the Taiponrock API or protocol into a user-friendly interface.

## ✨ Features

-   **Dedicated Taiponrock Node:** A custom node visible in the Node-RED palette for easy drag-and-drop usage.
-   **Intuitive Configuration:** Configure Taiponrock connection parameters and operational modes directly within the Node-RED editor's property panel.
-   **Seamless Integration:** Designed to integrate smoothly into existing Node-RED flows.
-   **Automation Ready:** Facilitates event-driven and scheduled interactions with Taiponrock systems.
-   **Open Source:** Developed under the Apache-2.0 License, fostering transparency and community contributions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

-   **Runtime Environment:** Node.js
-   **Platform:** Node-RED
-   **Frontend (Node-RED Editor UI):** HTML, JavaScript
-   **Backend (Node Logic):** JavaScript

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js:** `>=18.0.0`
-   **npm:** `>=8.0.0`
-   **Node-RED:** A running instance of Node-RED.

### Installing the Node

There are two primary ways to install `node-red-contrib-taiponrock`:

1.  **Via Node-RED Palette Manager (Recommended)**
    *   Open your Node-RED editor.
    *   Click the menu icon (top right, usually three horizontal lines).
    *   Select `Palette Manager`.
    *   Go to the `Install` tab.
    *   Search for `node-red-contrib-taiponrock`.
    *   Click the `install` button.

2.  **Via npm (Manual Installation)**
    *   Navigate to your Node-RED user directory (usually `~/.node-red`).
    *   Run the following npm command:
        ```bash
        npm install node-red-contrib-taiponrock
        ```
    *   Restart your Node-RED instance for the changes to take effect.

## 📖 Usage

Once installed, the `Taiponrock` node will appear in your Node-RED palette under the `network` or `input/output` category.

### Basic Flow Example (Conceptual)

1.  **Drag and drop** the `Taiponrock` node onto your flow.
2.  **Double-click** the node to open its configuration panel.
3.  **Configure** the node properties, which may include:
    *   `Name`: A descriptive name for the node.
    *   `Taiponrock Specific Settings`: (e.g., Device ID, Connection URL, API Key, Operation Type, etc. - **TODO: Specify actual configuration fields based on `node.html` analysis if content was available**)
4.  **Connect** an input node (e.g., an `Inject` node to trigger) to the `Taiponrock` node.
5.  **Connect** the output of the `Taiponrock` node to a `Debug` node to see its output.
6.  **Deploy** the flow.

A typical flow might look like this:

`[Inject Timestamp] --- > [Taiponrock Node] --- > [Debug Message]`

Or for sending commands:

`[Inject Command] --- > [Taiponrock Node] --- > [Debug Status]`

├── LICENSE           # Apache-2.0 License file
├── README.md         # This README file
├── node.html         # HTML file defining the Node-RED editor properties and help text for the 'taiponrock' node.

└── package.json      # Package manifest with metadata and Node-RED specific configuration.
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The `taiponrock` node is configured entirely within the Node-RED editor.

### Node Properties (Inferred from `node.html` structure)

When you double-click the `taiponrock` node in Node-RED, you will find properties to set. These typically include:

-   **Name**: (string) A unique name for the instance of the node.
-   **[Property 1]**: (type) Description of its purpose.
-   **[Property 2]**: (type) Description of its purpose.
-   ... (e.g., `device_id`, `api_key`, `endpoint`, `action`)

**TODO:** Detailed documentation of specific configuration properties, their types, and accepted values would require deeper inspection of `node.html` and `node.js`.

### Development Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/BenLazregAhmed/node-red-contrib-taiponrock.git
    cd node-red-contrib-taiponrock
    ```
2.  **Link the node to your Node-RED instance:**
    *   Navigate to your Node-RED user directory (usually `~/.node-red`).
    *   Create a symbolic link to your cloned repository:
        ```bash
        cd ~/.node-red
        npm link /path/to/your/cloned/node-red-contrib-taiponrock
        ```
    *   This allows you to make changes in the cloned directory and see them reflected in Node-RED after a restart.
3.  **Restart Node-RED:**
    ```bash
    node-red # or whatever command you use to start Node-RED
    ```

### Running Tests

The `package.json` currently indicates no specific tests are defined.
```bash
npm test

# Output: "Error: no test specified" && exit 1
```
For adding tests, consider using a testing framework like Mocha or Jest, and Node-RED's own testing utilities.
